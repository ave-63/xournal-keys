This lua plugin adds a bunch of key bindings that are quickly accessible with your left hand, mostly with no modifier keys required. Note that this ruins the text tool, because for example, typing `f` gets you out of text mode and into pen mode. So you have to change `f` to `<Ctrl>f` or something like that. 

To install, follow the instructions at https://xournalpp.github.io/guide/plugins/.
